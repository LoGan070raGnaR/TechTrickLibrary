# Traditional Installation Guide for Tar Files - Debian

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing applications from tar files on Debian using the traditional method. It includes a general guide that can be applied to any tar file installation, along with specific instructions for installing PyCharm.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Debian Linux installed
- Terminal or command-line access

## General Installation Steps

To install an application from a tar file using the traditional method, follow these steps:

1. Download the application tar file from the official website.

2. Once the download is complete, open a terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory where the downloaded tar file is located. For example, if it's in the Downloads directory, use the following command:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```

4. Extract the contents of the tar file using the tar command. Replace `<tar_file>` with the actual name of the downloaded file. For example:

    ```bash
    tar -xzf <tar_file>
    ```

    **Example (PyCharm):**

    ```bash
    tar -xzf pycharm-<pycharm_version>.tar.gz
    ```

5. Move the extracted folder to the desired installation location. For example, you can move it to `/opt`:

    ```bash
    sudo mv <extracted_folder> /opt/<application_name>
    ```

    **Example (PyCharm):**

    ```bash
    sudo mv pycharm-<pycharm_version> /opt/pycharm
    ```

6. Navigate to the application installation directory:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/<application_name>
    ```

    **Example (PyCharm):**

    ```bash
    cd /opt/pycharm/bin
    ```

7. Look for the main executable file or script that starts the application. It might have a specific name or be located in a `bin` directory.

    **Example (PyCharm):**

    The main executable file for PyCharm is `pycharm.sh`.

8. Run the executable file or script to start the application. Use the appropriate command or script name specific to the application.

    **Example (PyCharm):**

    ```bash
    ./pycharm.sh
    ```

9. Follow any on-screen instructions or additional steps required to complete the installation and initial configuration of the application.

## Creating a Desktop Launcher

When you install PyCharm using the manual method, it doesn't automatically create a launcher entry in the application menu. However, you can create a desktop launcher manually to make PyCharm accessible from the application menu.

To create a desktop launcher for PyCharm, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the `/usr/share/applications` directory:

    ```bash
    cd /usr/share/applications
    ```

3. Create a new desktop launcher file for PyCharm using a text editor (e.g., nano):

    ```bash
    sudo nano pycharm.desktop
    ```

4. In the text editor, paste the following contents for the desktop launcher:

    ```plaintext
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=PyCharm
    Comment=Python IDE
    Exec=/path/to/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh
    Icon=/path/to/pycharm/bin/pycharm.png
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=Development;IDE;
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/pycharm` with the actual path where you installed PyCharm.

5. Save the file (Ctrl + O in nano) and exit the text editor (Ctrl + X in nano).

Now, if you search for "PyCharm" in the application menu, you should see the PyCharm icon, and you can launch it from there.

By following these steps, you can install applications from tar files in the traditional way on Debian without using package managers or Snap.

**Note:** The exact steps may vary depending on the application you're installing. Refer to the application's documentation or installation instructions for more details.

## Making PyCharm Accessible from Anywhere in the Terminal

To make PyCharm accessible from anywhere in the terminal, you can create a symbolic link to the `pycharm.sh` script in a directory that is already included in your PATH environment variable.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to a directory that is included in your PATH variable, such as `/usr/local/bin`. You can check the directories in your PATH by running the command `echo $PATH`.

3. Create a symbolic link to the `pycharm.sh` script using the `ln` command. Replace `/path/to/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh` with the actual path to the `pycharm.sh` script on your system.

   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh /usr/local/bin/pycharm
   ```

Replace /path/to/pycharm with the actual path where you installed PyCharm.

After creating the symbolic link, you should be able to launch PyCharm from anywhere in the terminal by simply typing pycharm.

Please make sure to adjust the path in the command based on your actual PyCharm installation directory.
