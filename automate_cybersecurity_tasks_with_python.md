- Variables can be assigned to other variables.

## Best Practices for Naming Variables:
- Use letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Start with a letter or underscore (not a number).
- Case-sensitive: `time`, `Time`, and `TIME` are different variables.
- Avoid using Python's keywords or built-in functions.
- Separate words with underscores for better readability.
- Avoid similar names and unnecessarily long names.
- Names should describe the data they hold.

## Key Takeaways:
- Variables are containers for data and can be reassigned.

# Automation and Conditional Statements

## Automation:
- Reduces human effort in performing repetitive tasks.
- Allows computers to perform common tasks.

## Conditional Statements:
- Evaluate code based on specified conditions.
- Use the keyword "if" to start a conditional statement.
- Condition must be True for the specified action to be performed.
- Use comparison operators (e.g., greater than, equal to) to define conditions.

### Comparison Operators:
- Double equals (==) checks for equality.
- Exclamation mark followed by an equals sign (!=) checks for inequality.

## Example of Conditional Statement:
- Condition: Check if failed login attempts are greater than five.
- If condition is True, print "account locked" message.
- Use indentation to define the action block.
- Additional conditions can be added using the "else" keyword.

## Example of Using Double Equals:
- Condition: Check if the operating system matches a specific string.
- Use the double equals sign (==) for equality comparison.
- If condition is True, print "updates needed" message.
- Use the "else" statement for alternative actions.

## Benefits of Conditional Statements:
- Incorporate logic into code for decision-making.
- Automate actions based on specific conditions.

```python
#Create a conditional
operating_system = "OS 2"
if operating_system == "OS 2":
    print("Updates needed")

#Add an else statement
operating_system = "OS 3"
if operating_system == "OS 2":
    print("Updates needed")
else:
    print("No updates needed")
```

---

# More on Conditionals in Python

## How conditional statements work
A conditional statement is a statement that evaluates code to determine whether it meets a specific set of conditions. When a condition is met, it evaluates to a Boolean value of True and performs specified actions. When the condition isn’t met, it evaluates a Boolean value of False and doesn’t perform the specified actions.

## If statements
The keyword `if` starts a conditional statement. It’s a necessary component of any conditional statement. In the following example, if begins a statement that tells Python to print an "OK" message when the HTTP response status code equals 200:

```python
if status == 200:
    print("OK")
```

- The header of an if statement: The first line of the code is the header. It contains the keyword `if` followed by the condition.
- The body of an if statement: It comes after the header and specifies the action(s) to be performed when the condition evaluates to True.

## Continuing conditionals with else and elif

- `else` statements: The keyword `else` precedes a code section that only evaluates when all conditions preceding it within the conditional statement evaluate to False.
- `elif` statements: The keyword `elif` precedes a condition that is only evaluated when previous conditions evaluate to False.

### Example:

```python
if status == 200:
    print("OK")
elif status == 400:
    print("Bad Request")
elif status == 500:
    print("Internal Server Error")
else:
    print("check other status")
```

## Logical operators for multiple conditions

You can use logical operators to combine multiple conditions in your conditional statements:

- `and`: Requires both conditions on either side of the operator to evaluate to True.
- `or`: Requires only one of the conditions on either side of the operator to evaluate to True.
- `not`: Negates a given condition.

### Example

```python
if status >= 200 and status <= 226:
    print("successful response")

if status == 100 or status == 102:
    print("informational response")

if not(status >= 200 and status <= 226):
    print("check status")
```

## Key takeaways
- Conditional statements consist of a header and a body.
- The header contains the keyword (`if`, `else`, or `elif`) followed by a condition.
- The body specifies the action(s) to be performed when the condition(s) evaluate to True.
- `else` and `elif` statements provide alternative actions based on different conditions.

---

# Iterative Statements: Loops

- Iterative statements, also known as loops, allow computers to perform repetitive tasks.
- Loops save time and effort by executing a set of instructions repeatedly.
- There are two types of loops: for loops and while loops.
- For loops iterate over a specified sequence.
- The loop header contains the keyword `for`, a loop variable, and the sequence to iterate through.
- The loop variable controls the iterations and is used only within the loop.
- The loop body consists of indented lines that represent the actions to be repeated.
- The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers for loop iteration.
- By combining `for` loops with `range`, we can repeat a specific process a set number of times.
- The `range` function has a start point (optional) and a stop point (exclusive).
- If no start point is provided, it automatically starts from zero.
- The stop point is excluded, so the sequence goes up until the specified number minus one.

## Key takeaways
- Iterative statements allow computers to perform repetitive tasks.
- For loops iterate over a sequence using a loop variable.
- The loop header starts with `for` and ends with a colon.
- The loop body contains the actions to be repeated and is indented.
- The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers for loop iteration.
- Combining `for` loops with `range` allows for repeating a process a set number of times.

```python
#for loop
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    print(i)

#Run for loop with range
for i in range(10):
    print("Cannot connect to the destination.")
```

---

# Iterative Statements: While Loops

- While loops are another type of iterative statement in Python.
- While loops repeat code based on a condition.
- The loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true.
- The condition is evaluated before each iteration.
- The while loop has a header that starts with the keyword `while` followed by the condition and a colon.
- The loop variable used in while loops needs to be assigned a value before the loop.
- The loop body contains the actions to be repeated and is indented.
- The loop variable is modified within the loop body to control the iterations.
- While loops don't have a built-in sequence like for loops, so the loop variable changes must be explicitly defined.
- Practical examples can be implemented using while loops, such as enforcing limits or conditions.

## Key takeaways
- While loops repeat code based on a condition.
- The loop continues until the condition evaluates to false.
- The loop variable used in while loops must be assigned a value before the loop.
- The loop body contains the actions to be repeated and is indented.
- While loops are useful for scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown or based on a specific condition.

```python
#Create a while loop
max_devices = 5
i = 1

while i < 5:
    print("User can still connect to additional devices.")
    i = i + 1
print("User has reached maximum number of connected devices.")
```
---

# More on Loops in Python

Previously, you explored iterative statements. An iterative statement is code that repeatedly executes a set of instructions. In this reading, you’ll recap the syntax of loops and learn how to use the break and continue keywords to control the execution of loops.

## For Loops

If you need to iterate through a specified sequence, you should use a for loop. The following for loop iterates through a sequence of usernames:

```python
for i in ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore"]:
    print(i)
```

- The loop variable is `i`.
- The sequence to iterate through is `["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore"]`.
- The loop body prints the value of the loop variable.

You can also loop through a list or a string using for loops.

## Range Function

Another way to iterate through a for loop is by using the `range()` function. It generates a sequence of numbers based on the specified start, stop, and increment values.

### Example:

```python
for i in range(0, 5, 1):
    print(i)
```

- The loop iterates from 0 to 4, incrementing by 1.

## While Loops

While loops iterate based on a condition. The loop continues as long as the condition is true. Example:

```python
i = 1
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than 5.
You can use integers or boolean values in the loop condition.

## Managing Loops

You can control loop iterations using the `break` and `continue` keywords.

- `break` is used to exit a loop based on a condition.
- `continue` is used to skip an iteration and continue with the next one.

### Example with `break`:

```python
computer_assets = ["laptop1", "desktop20", "smartphone03"]
for asset in computer_assets:
    if asset == "desktop20":
        break
    print(asset)
```

### Example with `continue`:

```python
computer_assets = ["laptop1", "desktop20", "smartphone03"]
for asset in computer_assets:
    if asset == "desktop20":
        continue
    print(asset)
```

## Infinite Loops

An infinite loop is a loop that doesn't exit. Use `CTRL-C` or `CTRL-Z` to stop it. Be cautious when creating infinite loops.

These are the key takeaways:

- Use for loops to iterate through a sequence.
- Use while loops to iterate based on a condition.
- Use break and continue to control loop flow.

Let's dive deeper into understanding and utilizing functions in Python.

---

# User-Defined Functions in Python

User-defined functions allow us to create custom code blocks that perform specific tasks. Here's an overview of defining and calling a function:

1. Define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.
   - Example: `def greet_employee():`

2. Use a colon at the end of the function definition header.

3. Add the desired functionality of the function by indenting the code block.
   - Example: `print("Welcome!")`

4. Call the function by using the function name followed by parentheses.
   - Example: `greet_employee()`

5. The function will execute the code inside the function block when called.

Remember to include necessary comments to provide clarity in your code.

```python
#Define a function
def greet_employee():
    print("Welcome! You're logged in.")

#Call a function
greet_employee()
```

Next, we'll explore more advanced concepts to enhance the complexity and functionality of our functions.

# Python Functions in Cybersecurity

In cybersecurity, functions play a crucial role in improving efficiency and automating repetitive tasks. Here are key points about functions in Python and their relevance to cybersecurity:

## Functions in Cybersecurity
- Functions are sections of code that can be reused in a program, enabling automation of repetitive tasks.
- In cybersecurity, where repeated processes are common, functions are valuable for streamlining operations.

## Defining a Function
- Python has built-in functions (e.g., `print()`) and user-defined functions.
- To define a function, use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
- The function header informs Python that you are defining a function.
- The function body, indented after the header, contains the code that defines the function's purpose.

## Calling a Function
- After defining a function, it can be called multiple times in the code.
- Calling a function executes the code within its function body.
- Use the function name followed by parentheses to call a function.

### Example: `display_investigation_message()`
```python
def display_investigation_message():
    print("investigate activity")

display_investigation_message()
```

- The function `display_investigation_message()` is defined to print an "investigate activity" message.
- Calling the function `display_investigation_message()` executes the code within its body.

Note: Calling a function inside of the body of its function definition can create an infinite loop. This happens when it is not combined with logic that stops the function call when certain conditions are met. For example, in the following function definition, after you first call func1(), it will continue to call itself and create an infinite loop: 

```python
def func1():

    func1()
```

Remember, functions provide modularity and enhance code organization, making your programs more efficient and maintainable.

---

# Working with Parameters in Python Functions

In Python, functions can accept parameters, which are objects included in the function definition for use within the function. Here are key points about using parameters in functions:

## Parameters in Functions
- Parameters are defined in a function's parentheses after the function name.
- They allow functions to receive external information and perform actions based on that input.

### Example: `range()` Function
- The `range()` function takes parameters for the start and stop indices to generate a sequence of numbers.
- For example, `range(3, 7)` generates numbers from 3 to 6.

## Creating Functions with Parameters
- When defining a function with parameters, include the parameter name(s) inside the parentheses.
- The parameter name(s) represent the value(s) that will be passed into the function.
- Use the parameter value(s) within the function's body to perform specific actions.

## Calling Functions with Arguments
- Arguments are the actual values passed into a function when it is called.
- To call a function with arguments, provide the specific values inside the parentheses.
- Separate multiple arguments with commas.

### Example: Greeting Employees by Name
```python
def greet_employee(name):
    print("Welcome,", name, "!")
    
greet_employee("Charley Patel")
```

- The `greet_employee()` function is defined with a parameter named `name`.
- When calling the function with the argument "Charley Patel," it prints a personalized welcome message.

## Multiple Parameters in Functions
- Functions can have multiple parameters separated by commas.
- Adjust the function definition and function call accordingly to match the number of parameters and arguments.

Understanding how to use parameters allows you to create more flexible and dynamic functions in Python.

---

# Returning Information from Python Functions

In Python, return statements allow functions to send information back to the function call. Here are key points about returning information from functions:

## Return Statements
- A return statement is a Python statement used inside a function to send information back to the function call.
- It executes the statement and terminates the function, sending the specified information back.

## Use Cases for Return Statements
- Return statements are useful for security analysts to perform tasks such as checking access permissions or calculating percentages.
- For example, a function could check if a user is allowed access to a file and return a Boolean value of "True" or "False" to the larger program.

### Example: Calculating Percentage of Failed Login Attempts
```python
def calculate_fails(total_attempts, failed_attempts):
    fail_percentage = (failed_attempts / total_attempts) * 100
    return fail_percentage

percentage = calculate_fails(4, 2)
if percentage >= 50:
    print("Account locked")
```

- The `calculate_fails()` function takes two parameters: `total_attempts` and `failed_attempts`.
- It calculates the percentage of failed attempts and returns the value using the `return` statement.
- The returned value is stored in the `percentage` variable, which can be used in subsequent code.

Remember to use the `return` statement to send information back from a function and assign it to a variable for further use in your program.

---

# Functions and Variables

In this reading, we'll cover the following concepts related to functions and variables:

## Working with Variables in Functions
- Parameters: Objects included in a function definition for use within the function.
- Arguments: Data passed into a function when it is called.
- Return Statements: Used to return output from a function.

Note: The return keyword is not a function, so you should not place parentheses after it.

## Example: Calculating Remaining Login Attempts
```python
def remaining_login_attempts(maximum_attempts, total_attempts):
    return maximum_attempts - total_attempts

remaining_attempts = remaining_login_attempts(3, 3)
if remaining_attempts <= 0:
    print("Your account is locked")
```

## Global and Local Variables

- Global Variables: Accessible throughout the program and assigned outside of a function.
- Local Variables: Assigned within a function and can't be accessed outside of it.

 If you reuse the name of a global variable within a function, it will create a new local variable with that name. In other words, there will be both a global variable with that name and a local variable with that name, and they'll have different values. You can consider the following code block:

```python
username = "elarson"
print("1:" + username)
def greet():
    username = "bmoreno"
    print("2:" + username)
greet()
print("3:" + username)
```

## Best Practices for Global and Local Variables

- Avoid reusing variable names between global and local scopes.
- Functions can access the values of global variables, but it's better to use parameters instead.
- Combining global and local variables within functions can lead to complexity.

Remember to use clear and distinct variable names, understand the scope of variables, and follow best practices to avoid confusion when working with functions and variables.

---

# Built-in Functions

Python provides several built-in functions that can be called directly. Here are some important points to remember:

- Built-in functions can be used by calling them by their name.
- Examples of built-in functions are `print()` and `type()`.
- Functions can be used independently or together by passing one function as an argument to another.
- When working with built-in functions, it's crucial to understand their expected inputs and outputs.
- Some functions have specific requirements for data types and the number of parameters.
- The `print()` function can take any data type and any number of parameters.
- The `type()` function returns the data type of its input and accepts only one parameter.
- Consider the expected inputs, outputs, and requirements of a function before using it.
- Examples of other built-in functions are `max()` and `sorted()`.
- `max()` returns the largest numeric input passed to it and can accept any number of parameters.
- `sorted()` sorts the components of a list, which can be useful for sorting data alphabetically or numerically.

Explore and familiarize yourself with more built-in functions as you continue working with Python.

---

# Working with Built-in Functions

In Python, you can leverage built-in functions to perform various tasks. Here are the key points to remember:

## print()
- The `print()` function outputs an object to the screen.
- It accepts multiple arguments separated by commas.
- Example:
  ```python
  month = "September"
  print("Investigate failed login attempts during", month, "if more than", 100)
  ```
  
## type()
- The `type()` function returns the data type of its argument.
- It only accepts one argument.
- Example:
  ```python
  type("security") 
  ```
  
## Passing Functions
- Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, such as using `print()` with `type()`.
- Example:
  ```python
  print(type("This is a string"))
  ```
  
## max() and min()
- The `max()` function returns the largest numeric input passed to it.
- The `min()` function returns the smallest numeric input passed to it.
- They can take multiple arguments or an iterable (e.g., a list).
- Example:
  ```python
  time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
  print(min(time_list))
  print(max(time_list))
  ```
  
## sorted()
- The `sorted()` function sorts the components of a list or any iterable.
- It returns the sorted elements in a list, by default in ascending order.
- Example:
  ```python
  time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
  print(sorted(time_list))
  ```

# Working with Strings in Python

As a security analyst, understanding how to work with string data is crucial. Let's recap what we'll learn:

- Strings are an ordered sequence of characters.
- Strings are written in quotation marks.
- Variables can store strings.
- The string function converts other data types into strings.
- The length function returns the number of characters in a string.
- String concatenation combines two strings using the + symbol.
- Some operators, like subtraction, don't work with strings.
- String methods are functions that belong to a specific data type, in this case, strings.
- Two common string methods are the `upper()` and `lower()` methods.
    - The `upper()` method returns a copy of the string in all uppercase letters.
    - The `lower()` method returns a copy of the string in all lowercase letters.
- To use a string method, we place a period or dot after the string, followed by the method name.

Examples:
- Converting an integer to a string using the string function: `new_string = str(123)`
- Getting the length of a string: `print(len("Hello"))`
- Concatenating two strings: `print("Hello" + "world")`
- Using string methods: `print("Hello".upper())` or `print("Hello".lower())`

Next, we will delve into more string operations, such as indexing and splitting strings. Exciting things await!

---

# Indexing and Slicing Strings in Python

In security, searching through strings is often necessary. Here's what you need to know:

- Index is a number assigned to each element in a sequence, indicating its position.
- In Python, string indices start from 0.
- Accessing a specific character in a string is done by placing the index in square brackets.
- Slicing a string involves specifying a range of indices.
    - The first index is inclusive, while the second index is exclusive.
- The index method finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- Strings in Python are case-sensitive.
- Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.

Examples:
- Accessing a specific character: `"HELLO"[1]` returns "E".
- Slicing a string: `"HELLO"[1:4]` returns "ELL".
- Using the index method: `"HELLO".index("E")` returns 1.

Remember, indexing and slicing allow you to locate specific parts of a string efficiently. However, keep in mind that strings cannot be modified directly. Next, we'll explore list operations, where you can make changes using index notation.

---

# Working with Strings in Python

As a security analyst, understanding string manipulation is crucial. Here's what you need to know:

- String data is common in cybersecurity, storing information like IP addresses, usernames, and employee IDs.
- Indices represent the position of each character in a string, starting from 0.
- Bracket notation [ ] allows you to access individual characters or extract slices from a string.
- Negative indices count from the end of the string (-1 being the last character).
- String functions:
    - `str()` converts an object to a string.
    - `len()` returns the length of a string.
- String methods:
    - `.upper()` returns the string in uppercase.
    - `.lower()` returns the string in lowercase.
    - `.index()` finds the index of the first occurrence of a character or substring.
- Be cautious when using `.index()` for substrings, as it may return unexpected results.
- String manipulation is crucial for extracting relevant information and performing security analysis.

Remember, working effectively with strings is essential in the cybersecurity profession. Mastering these concepts will empower you to handle various data types and extract valuable insights.

# Working with Lists in Python

In the security profession, lists are essential for storing multiple data items. Here's what you need to know:

- Lists allow you to store multiple pieces of data in a single variable.
- To create a list, separate items with commas and enclose them in square brackets.
- Accessing elements from a list uses index values (starting from 0).

Example:
```python
my_list = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
print(my_list[1])  # Output: 'B'
```

- Lists can be concatenated using the plus sign.

Example:

```python
list1 = ['A', 'B', 'C']
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
concatenated_list = list1 + list2
print(concatenated_list)  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'C', 1, 2, 3]
```

- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove values.

Example:

```python
my_list[1] = 7
print(my_list)  # Output: ['A', 7, 'C', 'D', 'E']

my_list.insert(1, 7)
print(my_list)  # Output: ['A', 7, 7, 'C', 'D', 'E']

my_list.remove('D')
print(my_list)  # Output: ['A', 7, 7, 'C', 'E']
```

In the security profession, lists are often used for tasks like maintaining a list of malicious IP addresses. As new malicious IP addresses are identified, they can be easily added to the list.

Understanding lists is crucial for storing and manipulating data efficiently.

---

# Solving Problems with Algorithms in Python

In Python, algorithms are sets of rules that solve problems. Here's what you need to know:

- An algorithm is a set of steps that takes input, performs tasks, and returns a solution.
- Algorithms often involve concepts like loops, lists, and strings.

### Example: Extracting network information from IP addresses
```python
IP = ['198.567.xxx.xxx', '123.456.xxx.xxx', '789.012.xxx.xxx']
networks = []

# Extract the first three characters from each IP address
for address in IP:
    network = address[:3]
    networks.append(network)

print(networks)  # Output: ['198', '123', '789']
```

- String slicing is used to extract specific parts of a string.
- Loops can be used to apply a solution to multiple elements in a list.
- The `append()` method adds an element to the end of a list.

Remember to break down complex problems into smaller steps when designing algorithms.

Algorithms are powerful tools for solving problems efficiently in Python.

# Lists and the security analyst

Previously, you examined how to use bracket notation to access and change elements in a list and some fundamental methods for working with lists. This reading will review these concepts with new examples, introduce the `.index()` method as it applies to lists, and highlight how lists are used in a cybersecurity context.

## List data in a security setting

- List data is a data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form.
- Lists can store multiple elements in a single variable and can contain multiple data types.
- In a cybersecurity context, lists might be used to store usernames, IP addresses, URLs, device IDs, and data.

## Working with indices in lists

- Indices start at 0 in lists.
- You can use bracket notation to extract elements or slices in a list.
- Elements in a list can be changed using bracket notation.

### Bracket notation

- To extract an element from a list, use square brackets containing the index of the element.
- Example: `username_list[2]` extracts the element with an index of 2 from the variable `username_list`.

### Extracting a slice from a list

- Use bracket notation with two indices to extract a sublist from a list.
- Example: `username_list[0:2]` returns the sublist `["elarson", "fgarcia"]`.

### Changing the elements in a list

- Use bracket notation to change elements in a list.
- Example: `username_list[1] = "bmoreno"` changes the element at index 1 of `username_list` to "bmoreno".

## List methods

List methods are functions that are specific to the list data type. These include the `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.append()`, and `.index()` methods.

### .insert()

- The `.insert()` method adds an element in a specific position inside a list.
- Example:
```python
username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
username_list.insert(2, "wjaffrey")
```

### .remove()

- The `.remove()` method removes the first occurrence of a specific element in a list.
- Example:

```python
username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "wjaffrey", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
username_list.remove("elarson")
```

### .append()

- The `.append()` method adds an element to the end of a list.
- Example:

```python
username_list = ["bmoreno", "wjaffrey", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
username_list.append("btang")
```


### .index()

- The `.index()` method finds the index of the first occurrence of an element in a list.
- Example:

```python
username_list = ["bmoreno", "wjaffrey", "tshah", "sgilmore", "btang"]
username_index = username_list.index("tshah")
```

## Key takeaways

- Bracket notation allows extraction, alteration, and slicing of lists.
- List methods provide functionality to add, remove, and find elements in a list.

# Working with Regular Expressions in Python

In this guide, we will explore the power of regular expressions in Python for searching and extracting patterns in strings.

## Introduction to Regular Expressions

A **regular expression** (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a pattern. Regular expressions are powerful tools for searching within log files or any string data. They allow us to find patterns and match specific structures.

Regular expressions can be used in various contexts, such as searching for specific patterns like IP addresses or email addresses. Even when given a log file with thousands of entries, regular expressions enable us to extract relevant information without knowing the specific details.

## The Plus Sign Symbol (+)

The plus sign symbol (`+`) in regular expressions represents one or more occurrences of a specific character. For example, the pattern `a+` matches a string of any length in which the letter "a" is repeated one or more times.

## The \w Symbol

Another building block of regular expressions is the `\w` symbol, which matches any alphanumeric character. However, it does not match symbols or special characters.

Regular expressions can combine symbols to allow for even more complex patterns. When we combine `\w` with the plus sign (`+`), the pattern `\w+` matches an alphanumeric string of any length.

## Extracting Email Addresses with Regular Expressions

Now, let's apply regular expressions to extract email addresses from a log. Email addresses consist of text separated by certain symbols, such as the `@` symbol and the period.

A typical email address format is `user@example.com`. We can represent this as a regular expression pattern by breaking it down into segments:

- The first segment contains alphanumeric characters and can vary in length. We can use the pattern `\w+` for this segment.
- The second segment is the `@` symbol, which is always present.
- The domain name is the next segment and also contains alphanumeric characters. Again, we can use the pattern `\w+` to match this segment.
- Finally, the last segment is the period, which we need to represent as `\.` in the regular expression to avoid its special meaning.

Putting all the segments together, the regular expression pattern to match email addresses is: `\w+@\w+\.\w+`. This pattern will match all email addresses and exclude everything else in the string.

Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to use regular expressions to extract email addresses from a log:

```python
import re

# Restore the log as a multi-line string variable
email_log = """
Email received June 2 from user1@email.com.
Email received June 3 from user2@email.com.
Email rejected June 4 from invalid_email@email.com.
"""

# Use regular expressions to extract email addresses from the log
pattern = r'\w+@\w+\.\w+'
emails = re.findall(pattern, email_log)
print(emails)
```

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and searching within strings. I encourage you to explore further and learn more about the various symbols and techniques used in regular expressions.

---

# More about Regular Expressions

## Basics of regular expressions
- Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters used to search for patterns in strings.
- Import the `re` module in Python to work with regular expressions.

## Regular expression symbols
- Alphanumeric characters can be matched using `\w`.
- Special symbols:
  - `.` matches any character, including symbols.
  - `\d` matches single digits [0-9].
  - `\s` matches single spaces.
  - `\.`, when escaped with a backslash, matches the period character.
- Symbols for quantifying occurrences:
  - `+` represents one or more occurrences of a character.
  - `*` represents zero, one, or more occurrences of a character.
  - `{}` with a number inside specifies the exact number of repetitions.
  - `{n, m}` specifies a range of repetitions.

## Using regular expressions
- Use the `re.findall()` function to search for matches and return a list of matches.
- Construct a regular expression by breaking down the desired pattern into smaller components.
- Test your regular expressions to ensure they return the desired matches.

## Example:
```python
import re

pattern = "\w+:\s\d+"
employee_logins_string = "1001 bmoreno: 12 Marketing 1002 tshah: 7 Human Resources 1003 sgilmore: 5 Finance"
print(re.findall(pattern, employee_logins_string))
```
Output:
```python
['bmoreno: 12', 'tshah: 7', 'sgilmore: 5']
```
Regular expressions provide a flexible and efficient way to search for specific patterns in strings.

```

---

# Importing and Working with Files in Python

## Working with files in cybersecurity
- Security analysts often need to access files, particularly logs.
- Logs contain records of events in an organization's systems, useful for identifying security issues.

## Opening files in Python
- Use the `with` statement and the `open()` function to open files.
- Specify the file name and the desired mode (`"r"` for reading, `"w"` for writing, `"a"` for appending).
- Use the `with` statement to automatically close the file after use.
- Absolute file paths may be necessary when the file is not in the same directory as the Python file.

Example: Opening a file for reading
```python
with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:
    # Code to handle the file
```

### Example: Opening a file with an absolute file path

```python
with open("/home/analyst/logs/access_log.txt", "r") as file:
    # Code to handle the file
```

## Reading files in Python

- Use the `.read()` method to convert files into strings.
- After opening a file, read its contents and store them in a variable.
- Perform operations on the file contents as you would with any other string.

### Example: Reading and printing the contents of a file

```python
with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:
    updates = file.read()
    print(updates)
```

## Writing files in Python

- Use `"w"` to replace the contents of an existing file or create a new file.
- Use `"a"` to append new information to an existing file.
- Use the `.write()` method to write string data to the file.

### Example: Appending a line to a file

```python
line = "jrafael,192.168.243.140,4:56:27,True"

with open("access_log.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(line)
```

Note: Calling the `.write()` method without using the `with` keyword when importing the file might result in its arguments not being completely written to the file if the file is not properly closed in another way.


## Key takeaways

- Importing and working with files is crucial for security analysts.
- Use the `with` statement, `open()`, `.read()`, and `.write()` methods.
- Understand the different modes for opening files: `"r"`, `"w"`, and `"a"`.
- Absolute file paths may be required when the file is not in the same directory as the Python file.

# Parsing Text Files in Python

## Introduction
- Parsing is the process of converting data into a more readable format.
- We can parse text files to analyze them more easily.

## Splitting Strings with the Split Method
- The split method converts a string into a list.
- It separates the string based on a specified character or whitespace.
- The split method helps us analyze text by splitting it into smaller chunks.

Example: Splitting a string into a list
```python
text = "We are learning about parsing!"
split_text = text.split()
print(split_text)
```
## Parsing Security Logs

- Security logs often have each line representing a new data point.
- We can use the split method to separate the text based on new lines.

Example: Parsing a security log file

```python
with open("security_log.txt", "r") as file:
    log_data = file.read()
    log_lines = log_data.split("\n")
    print(log_lines)
```

## Saving the Parsed Data

- Assign the split result to a variable to save the parsed data.
- The variable can be reused in other code for further analysis.

Example: Saving parsed data into a variable

```python
with open("security_log.txt", "r") as file:
    log_data = file.read()
    log_lines = log_data.split("\n")
    usernames = log_lines
    print(usernames)
```

---

# Detecting Suspicious Login Attempts

## Introduction
- We want to create a program that detects suspicious login attempts.
- The program checks if a user has three or more failed login attempts.

## Program Structure
- We have a log file in .txt format with one username per line.
- When a user logs in, the program checks for their username and counts its occurrences.
- If the username appears three or more times, an alert is triggered.

## Importing and Parsing the Log File
```python
with open("login_attempts.txt", "r") as file:
    log_data = file.read()
    usernames = log_data.split("\n")
    print(usernames)
```

## Counting Username Occurrences

- Use a for loop to iterate through each element of the usernames list.
- Initialize a counter variable and increment it whenever the username is found.

Example: Counting username occurrences

```python
def login_check(login_list, current_user):
    counter = 0
    for username in login_list:
        if username == current_user:
            counter += 1
    if counter >= 3:
        print("Account locked. Too many failed login attempts.")
    else:
        print("Login successful.")

# Example usage:
login_check(usernames, "eraab")
```

Now you've developed a basic security algorithm to detect suspicious login attempts. There are ways to optimize this algorithm, but this solution works effectively for now.

# Debugging Your Code

## Introduction
- Debugging is the practice of identifying and fixing errors in code.
- There are three types of errors: syntax errors, logic errors, and exceptions.

## Syntax Errors
- Syntax errors involve invalid usage of the Python language.
- They are easy to fix as the error message provides information about the location of the error.

## Logic Errors
- Logic errors produce unintended results.
- Print statements and debuggers can help identify and isolate logic errors.

## Exceptions
- Exceptions occur when the program doesn't know how to execute code.
- They can happen due to mathematical impossibilities, accessing non-existent index values, or using incorrect data types.
- Debuggers and print statements can help identify the source of exception errors.

Dealing with errors and exceptions is an essential skill for a security analyst to ensure functional and error-free code.

# Debugging Code: Helping Co-workers

## Purpose of the Code
- The code's purpose is to parse a single line from a log file and return it.
- Lines with a status code of 200 shouldn't be parsed; instead, a message should be returned.

## Code Snippet
```python
# Parse information from a log file if the status code != 200
# Function to parse a log file line
def parse_log_line(line)
    error_code = line[0:3]
    
    date = line[4:12]
    time = line[13:21]
    aplication_name = line[22:43]
    
    parsed_line = []
    parsed_line.insert(0, error_code)
    parsed_line.insert(1, date)
    parsed_line.insert(2, time)
    parsed_line.insert(3, application_name)
    
    return parsed_line

    if (error_code == "200"):
        return "Successful event - no parsing needed."

final_parsed_line = parse_log_line("200 02032180 07:21:00 buffer_application")
print(final_parsed_line)
```

## Debugging Process
1. Identify errors by running the code.
2. Fix syntax errors (e.g., missing colon in function header).
3. Address name errors (a type of exception) by correcting misspelled variable names.
4. Verify the logic of the program by examining the output.
5. Use print statements to identify the source of the issue.
6. Move the if statement to check the status code before returning the parsed line.
7. Test the code again to confirm the fix.

Debugging code involves identifying and fixing errors, including syntax errors, exceptions, and logic errors, to ensure smooth and correct program execution.

## Code Snippet
```python
# Parse information from a log file if the status code != 200
# Function to parse a log file line
def parse_log_line(line):
    error_code = line[0:3]
    
    if (error_code == "200"):
        return "Successful event - no parsing needed."
    
    date = line[4:12]
    time = line[13:21]
    application_name = line[22:43]
    
    parsed_line = []
    parsed_line.insert(0, error_code)
    parsed_line.insert(1, date)
    parsed_line.insert(2, time)
    parsed_line.insert(3, application_name)
    
    return parsed_line

final_parsed_line = parse_log_line("200 02032180 07:21:00 buffer_application")
print(final_parsed_line)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a function (`parse_log_line`) for parsing log file lines. It includes error handling for lines with a status code of 200, which returns a specific message instead of parsing. The code has been debugged to fix syntax errors, name errors, and logic errors.

# Debugging Techniques

## Types of Errors
- Syntax errors: Invalid usage of programming language syntax.
- Logic errors: Unintended results due to flawed logic.
- Exceptions: Code that cannot be executed despite being syntactically correct.

## Syntax Errors
- Occur due to mistakes in Python syntax.
- Error messages indicate the location and description of the error.
- Common examples include missing punctuation marks and colons.

### Before Debugging Code:
```python
message = "You are debugging a syntax error
print(message)

#Output: SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

### After Debugging Code:

```python
message = "You are debugging a syntax error"
print(message)

#Output: You are debugging a syntax error
```
## Logic Errors

- Result from flawed logic in the code.
- May not produce error messages but cause unexpected behavior.
- Examples include using the wrong logical operator or incorrect assignments.

### Before Debugging Code:

```python
login_attempts = 5
if login_attempts >= 5:
    print("User has not reached maximum number of login attempts.")
else:
    print("User has reached maximum number of login attempts.")

#Output: User has not reached maximum number of login attempts.
```

### After Debugging Code:

```python
login_attempts = 5
if login_attempts > 5:
    print("User has not reached maximum number of login attempts.")
else:
    print("User has reached maximum number of login attempts.")

#Output: User has reached maximum number of login attempts.
```

## Exceptions

- Errors that prevent code execution despite being syntactically correct.
- Common causes include variables or functions not being assigned or defined.
- Different exception types include NameError, IndexError, TypeError, and FileNotFoundError.

### Before Debugging Code:

```python
username = "elarson"
month = "March"
total_logins = 75
failed_logins = 18
print("Login report for", username, "in", month)
print("Total logins:", total_logins)
print("Failed logins:", failed_logins)
print("Unusual logins:", unusual_logins)

#Output: NameError: name 'unusual_logins' is not defined
```

### After Debugging Code:

```python
username = "elarson"
month = "March"
total_logins = 75
failed_logins = 18
unusual_logins = 5
print("Login report for", username, "in", month)
print("Total logins:", total_logins)
print("Failed logins:", failed_logins)
print("Unusual logins:", unusual_logins)

'''Output:
Login report for elarson in March
Total logins: 75
Failed logins: 18
Unusual logins: 5
'''
```

## Debugging Strategies
- **Debuggers**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with debugging tools and breakpoints.
- **Print statements**: Insert temporary print statements to identify the source of errors.
- Analyze variable values and code flow to locate logic errors.

### Before Debugging Code:

```python
new_users = ["sgilmore", "bmoreno"]
approved_users = ["bmoreno", "tshah", "elarson"]
def add_users():
    for user in new_users:
        if user in approved_users:
            print(user, "already in list")
        approved_users.append(user)

add_users()
print(approved_users)

'''Output:
bmoreno already in list
['bmoreno', 'tshah', 'elarson', 'sgilmore', 'bmoreno']
'''
```

### After Debugging Code:

```python
new_users = ["sgilmore", "bmoreno"]
approved_users = ["bmoreno", "tshah", "elarson"]
def add_users():
    for user in new_users:
        if user in approved_users:
            print(user, "already in list")
        else:
            approved_users.append(user)

add_users()
print(approved_users)

'''Output:
sgilmore already in list
['bmoreno', 'tshah', 'elarson', 'sgilmore']
'''
```
